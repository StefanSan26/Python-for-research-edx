The information available about each movie is its budget, revenue, rating, actors and actresses, etc. In this case study, we will use this dataset to determine whether any information about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. We will also attempt to predict whether a movie's revenue will exceed its budget.\n",

    "In this exercise, we will compute the cross-validated performance for the linear and random forest regression models for positive revenue movies only.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "- Call `cross_val_score` using `linear_regression` and `forest regression` as models. Store the output as `linear_regression_scores` and `forest_regression_scores`, respectively.\n",
    "    - Set the parameters `cv=10` to use 10-fold cross-validation and `scoring=correlation` to use our `correlation` function defined in the previous exercise.\n",
    "- Plotting code has been provided to compare the performance of the two models. Use `plt.show()` to plot the correlation between actual and predicted revenue for each cross-validation fold using the linear and random forest regression models.\n",
    "- Which of the two models exhibits a better fit? Is this result different from what we observed when considering all movies?\n",
    "- Code is provided for you that prints the importance of each covariate in predicting revenue using the random forests classifier. \n",
    "    - Which variables are most important?"
